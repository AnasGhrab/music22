Diastema: Musical intervals and modality analysis
=================================================

Overview
========

**Diastema**, is a project to analyse musical modality.

For now, it's main features are :

* Fondamental frequencies extraction (using *PredominentMelody()* from **Essentia**);
* Getting the main frequencies as peaks of the probability density function from frequencies;
* Comparing PDFs using a correlation coefficient;
* Getting a similarity matrix between melodies.
